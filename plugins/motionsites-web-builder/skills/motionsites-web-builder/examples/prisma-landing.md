Create a React + Vite + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS landing page for a creative studio called "Prisma". The page has 3 sections: Hero, About, and Features. Use framer-motion for animations and lucide-react for icons. The design is dark, moody, and cinematic with a warm cream color palette.

FONTS

Load two Google Fonts in index.html:

Almarai (weights: 300, 400, 700, 800) -- used as the global default font
Instrument Serif (italic only) -- used for italic accent text in the About section
In index.css, set the global font family:


* { font-family: 'Almarai', -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', 'Roboto', 'Oxygen', 'Ubuntu', 'Cantarell', sans-serif; }
In tailwind.config.js, extend:

colors.primary: #DEDBC8 (warm cream, used for all primary text and accents)
fontFamily.serif: ['"Instrument Serif"', 'serif']
COLOR SYSTEM

Background: black (#000000) globally, #101010 for the About card, #212121 for Features cards
Primary text color: #E1E0CC (applied via inline style, slightly different from Tailwind primary)
Tailwind primary: #DEDBC8 (used for utility classes like text-primary, text-primary/70)
Gray text: text-gray-400, text-gray-500
Navbar link color: rgba(225, 224, 204, 0.8) with hover: #E1E0CC
CUSTOM CSS UTILITIES (index.css)

Two SVG noise texture utilities:

.noise-overlay: fractal noise (baseFrequency: 0.85, numOctaves: 3) used as overlay on hero video
.bg-noise: fractal noise (baseFrequency: 0.9, numOctaves: 4) used as subtle background in Features section
Both use inline SVG data URIs with feTurbulence filter.

SECTION 1: HERO

Full viewport height (h-screen). The entire section has p-4 md:p-6 padding creating an inset effect. Inside is a container with rounded-2xl md:rounded-[2rem] and overflow-hidden.

All feature card checklist items use Check icon from lucide-react in text-primary color, with text-gray-400 description text. "Learn more" buttons use ArrowRight rotated -45deg.

SHARED ANIMATION COMPONENTS

WordsPullUp: Splits text by spaces, each word is a motion.span that slides up (y:20 to 0) with staggered delay. Uses useInView (once: true). Supports showAsterisk prop that adds a superscript * after the last character "a" of the final word.

WordsPullUpMultiStyle: Takes an array of {text, className} segments, splits all into individual words preserving per-word className. Same pull-up animation. Words are wrapped in inline-flex flex-wrap justify-center.

RESPONSIVE BREAKPOINTS

The page is fully responsive across mobile, tablet, and desktop. Cards in Features switch from 1-col (mobile) to 2-col (md) to 4-col (lg). Hero text scales from 26vw down to 19vw. Navbar items compress with smaller gaps on mobile. All padding, font sizes, and spacing use Tailwind responsive prefixes (sm/md/lg/xl/2xl).
